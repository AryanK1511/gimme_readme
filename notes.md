# Terms with regards to testing

- code paths
- fuzz testing
- assertions
  - match
- mocks
  - independent from the environment from where it runs
  - don't need to talk to a real database
  - don't need to use the actual file system
  - test against _fake_ implementations
- coverage
  - which code paths were visited
  - do we need to write more tests to _cover_ everything
