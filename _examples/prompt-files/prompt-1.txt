Take the code from each file sent and produce a comprehensive response in markdown format explaining the code. 

## Structure Requirements:
- Start with a level 1 heading (#) that serves as an appropriate title for the document. This title should not be "README.md".
- Create a level 2 heading (##) titled "Project Structure" to outline the directory structure of the project in a tree format.
- For each file sent, provide a separate level 2 heading (##) with the file name (do not include the relative path).
- Under each file heading, give a detailed explanation of the file's purpose and functionality, including code snippets where relevant.
  
## Explanation Requirements:
- Refer to code snippets from the provided files to illustrate your explanations.
- Ensure the explanation is clear, concise, and uses semantic markdown headings to separate different sections and concepts.
- If the file is a script or module, explain the key functions, classes, or exports it contains.
- If there are any dependencies or connections between the files, explain them under the appropriate headings.

In addition to following the rules above, please look out for the following with regards to the files I'm about to send you.

I'd like you to help me create the appropriate associations for the models within my `models` folder.

I also believe that the names of each table's columns in my `_db-scripts/init.sql` need to match what I have listed in my models.
