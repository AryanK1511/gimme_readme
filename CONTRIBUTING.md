## Code of Conduct

This project and everyone participating in it is governed by the [gimme_readme Code of Conduct](https://github.com/peterdanwan/gimme_readme/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
By participating, you are expected to uphold this code. Please report unacceptable behavior to <pwan6@myseneca.ca>.

## I Have a Question

> If you want to ask a question, we assume that you have read the available [Documentation](https://github.com/peterdanwan/gimme_readme) and [Examples](https://github.com/peterdanwan/gimme_readme/blob/main/_examples/README.md).

Before asking a question, please search for existing [Issues](https://github.com/peterdanwan/gimme_readme/issues) that might help you. In case you have found a suitable issue and still need clarification, you can write your question in this issue.

If you still need to ask a question or require clarification, we recommend:

1. Opening an [Issue](https://github.com/peterdanwan/gimme_readme/issues/new).
2. Providing as much context as you can about what you're running into. (Posting code snippets, screenshots, videos etc. are welcome!).
3. Providing project and platform versions (nodejs, npm, etc), depending on what seems relevant.

We will then take care of the issue as soon as possible.

### Reporting Bugs

<!-- omit in toc -->

#### Before Submitting a Bug Report

A good bug report shouldn't leave others needing to chase you up for more information. Therefore, we ask you to investigate carefully, collect information and describe the issue in detail in your report. Please complete the following steps in advance to help us fix any potential bug as fast as possible.

- Make sure that you are using the latest version.
- Determine if your bug is really a bug and not an error on your side e.g., using incompatible environment components/versions (ensure that you have read the [documentation](https://github.com/peterdanwan/gimme_readme). If you are looking for support, you might want to check [this section](#i-have-a-question)).
- To see if other users have experienced (and potentially already solved) the same issue you are having, check if there is not already a bug report existing for your bug or error in the [bug tracker](https://github.com/peterdanwan/gimme_readme/issues?q=label%3Abug).
- Also make sure to search the internet (including Stack Overflow) to see if users outside of the GitHub community have discussed the issue.
- Collect information about the bug:
  - Stack trace (Traceback)
  - OS, Platform and Version (Windows, Linux, macOS, x86, ARM)
  - Version of the interpreter, compiler, SDK, runtime environment, package manager, depending on what seems relevant.
  - Possibly your input and the output
  - Can you reliably reproduce the issue? And can you also reproduce it with older versions?

<!-- omit in toc -->

#### How Do I Submit a Good Bug Report?

> You must never report security related issues, vulnerabilities or bugs including sensitive information to the issue tracker, or elsewhere in public. Instead sensitive bugs must be sent by email to <pwan6@myseneca.ca>.

<!-- You may add a PGP key to allow the messages to be sent encrypted as well. -->

We use GitHub issues to track bugs and errors. If you run into an issue with the project:

- Open an [Issue](https://github.com/peterdanwan/gimme_readme/issues/new). (Since we can't be sure at this point whether it is a bug or not, we ask you not to talk about a bug yet and not to label the issue.)
- Explain the behavior you would expect and the actual behavior.
- Please provide as much context as possible and describe the _reproduction steps_ that someone else can follow to recreate the issue on their own. This usually includes your code. For good bug reports you should isolate the problem and create a reduced test case.
- Provide the information you collected in the previous section.

Once it's filed:

- The project team will label the issue accordingly.
- A team member will try to reproduce the issue with your provided steps. If there are no reproduction steps or no obvious way to reproduce the issue, the team will ask you for those steps and mark the issue as `needs-repro`. Bugs with the `needs-repro` tag will not be addressed until they are reproduced.
- If the team is able to reproduce the issue, it will be marked `needs-fix`, as well as possibly other tags (such as `critical`), and the issue will be left to be [implemented by someone](#your-first-code-contribution).

<!-- You might want to create an issue template for bugs and errors that can be used as a guide and that defines the structure of the information to be included. If you do so, reference it here in the description. -->

### Suggesting Enhancements

This section guides you through submitting an enhancement suggestion for gimme_readme, **including completely new features and minor improvements to existing functionality**. Following these guidelines will help maintainers and the community to understand your suggestion and find related suggestions.

<!-- omit in toc -->

#### Before Submitting an Enhancement

- Ensure you are using the latest version of `gimme_readme`
- Read the [documentation](https://github.com/peterdanwan/gimme_readme) and [examples](https://github.com/peterdanwan/gimme_readme/blob/main/_examples/README.md) carefully to find out if a feature is already covered through an individual configuration.
- Search the [list of existing issues](https://github.com/peterdanwan/gimme_readme/issues?q=is%3Aissue+label%3Aenhancement) to see if an enhancement has already been suggested. If it has, add a comment to the existing issue instead of opening a new one and like the original issue's description.
- Determine if your idea fits with the scope of the project. It's up to you to make a strong case to convince the project's developers of the merits of this feature. Keep in mind that we want features that will be useful to the majority of our users and not just a small subset. If you're just targeting a minority of users, consider writing an add-on/plugin library.

<!-- omit in toc -->

#### How Do I Submit a Good Enhancement Suggestion?

Enhancement suggestions are tracked using [GitHub issues](https://github.com/peterdanwan/gimme_readme/issues), just like [bugs](#reporting-bugs).

To log a good issue, we suggest:

- **Adding a clear and descriptive title** for the issue to identify the suggestion.
- **Providing a step-by-step description of the suggested enhancement** with as many details as possible.
- **Describing the current behavior** and **explaining the behavior you expect to see instead**, and why. You can also tell clarify which alternatives do not work for you.
- **Including code snippets, screenshots, videos, and/or animated GIFs** to help demonstrate the steps of possible solutions or end results.
- **Explain why this enhancement would be useful** to most gimme_readme users. You may also want to reference other projects that solved it better and which could serve as inspiration.

### Your First Code Contribution

We're excited to help you make your first code contribution! Here's a comprehensive guide to get you started:

#### Prerequisite Tools

- [Node.js (LTS version recommended)](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) - we have some [recommended extensions](./.vscode/extensions.json) to install

#### Development Setup

1. Fork this repository, and clone your _forked_ repository to your local machine. Follow the guide [here](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/fork-a-repo) if you are unsure how to do this.
2. After [cloning your forked repository to your local machine](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/fork-a-repo#cloning-your-forked-repository), navigate to the _root_ of the cloned repository and run the following:

   ```sh
   # Remove the pre-existing, global installation of the gimme_readme repository.
   npm uninstall -g gimme_readme

   # Install the necessary node_modules
   npm i

   # Simulate the environment as if gimme_readme was installed globally via `npm i -g gimme_readme`
   # You can now use the `gr-ai` executable, and changes to your source code should be reflected when you make changes to the repo
   # If your changes aren't reflected after changing the source code, repeat the commands above in sequence.
   npm link
   ```

#### Making and Testing Changes

1. Create a new branch for your feature/fix:

   ```sh
    # Create a new branch, that is based off of your local main branch
    git checkout -b <branch-name> main
   ```

   > We maintain that it's always a best practice to _never_ work off of your `main` branch, and instead, work on a separate branch. You should do your best to ensure that your `local main` branch, and your `downstream main branch` on GitHub, is in-sync with the [upstream main branch](https://github.com/peterdanwan/gimme_readme).

2. After adding new code or modifying existing code, please try to add a `test` case for these changes (if applicable). Run the following commands to ensure your current changes are: formatted properly, have no code lint (i.e., potential for bugs), and don't break any new or existing test cases:

   ```sh
    # To spot any formatting issues and automatically fix them
    npm run format

    # To spot any code issues (performed after formatting)
    npm run lint

    # To see if any of the existing tests are broken/need to be updated based on your update
    npm run test
   ```

   > NOTE 1: with regards to linting, there may be an off chance that you want to _ignore_ a certain suggestion. We maintain that we normally don't suggest doing this, in favour of avoiding code that requires a linting rule to be ignored altogether. However, if it is _absolutely necessary_ for you to ignore a rule so that ESLint does not complain, please see this [guide](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/use/configure/rules).
   >
   > NOTE 2: All of these scripts are defined in [package.json](./package.json), under the "scripts" section.

3. When you're ready to make a commit, this repository has been configured to run a [pre-commit hook](.husky/pre-commit) which _also_ runs the following _automatically_, just in case you haven't done so already:

   ```sh
    # Formats all JavaScript files in src/ and tests/ directories using Prettier
    # This will automatically fix formatting issues like indentation, spacing, and quotes
    npm run format

    # Runs ESLint on all JavaScript files in src/ and tests/ directories (run deliberately after formatting).
    # This checks for potential errors, bugs, and code style violations
    npm run lint

    # To see if any of the existing tests are broken/need to be updated based on your update
    npm run test
   ```

   > This pre-commit hook aims to ensure that your commit passes the [continuous integration tests](.github/workflows/ci.yml). If your code fails the `lint` or `test` commands, you'll notice that your commit will not go through. You'll need to address these issues _first_, and then redo your commit.

#### Visual Studio Code Editor Integration

As mentioned in [Prerequisite tools](#prerequisite-tools), part of developing `gimme_readme` involves using `Visual Studio Code` as your editor. When you open the `gimme_readme` repository with `Visual Studio Code`, it should suggest that you install several extensions if they haven't been installed already. `Visual Studio Code` specific configurations can be found in the `.vscode` folder.

Here are some explanations of the file at the time of writing:

1. Required Extensions: ([.vscode/extensions.json](.vscode/extensions.json))

   ```json
   {
     "recommendations": [
       "esbenp.prettier-vscode", // Prettier formatter integration
       "dbaeumer.vscode-eslint", // ESLint integration
       "streetsidesoftware.code-spell-checker" // Spell checking
       "yzhang.markdown-all-in-one",         // Enhanced Markdown support (e.g., shortcuts to make text bold)
       "DavidAnson.vscode-markdownlint"      // Markdown linting
     ]
   }
   ```

   > If you don't have these extensions installed, Visual Studio Code will alert you to install these extensions.

2. Workspace Settings: ([.vscode/settings.json](.vscode/settings.json))

   ```json
   {
     "editor.insertSpaces": true, // Use spaces instead of tabs
     "editor.tabSize": 2, // 2 spaces per tab
     "editor.detectIndentation": false, // Don't auto-detect indentation
     "editor.defaultFormatter": "esbenp.prettier-vscode", // Use Prettier as default formatter
     "editor.formatOnSave": true, // Auto-format files when saving
     "editor.codeActionsOnSave": {
       "source.fixAll": "explicit" // Auto-fix linting issues on save
     },
     "files.eol": "\n", // Use Unix-style line endings
     "files.insertFinalNewline": true // Add newline at end of files
   }
   ```

3. JavaScript specific code snippet ([.vscode/javascript.code-snippets](.vscode/javascript.code-snippets))

   ```json
   {
     "Insert Current File Path Comment": {
       "prefix": "rpath",
       "body": ["// ${RELATIVE_FILEPATH/[\\\\]/\\//g}"],
       "description": "Inserts a comment with the relative path of the current file"
     }
   }
   ```

   > Type `rpath` and press `Enter` to insert the current file's path as a comment.

Having these configuration files ensures that:

- Code is automatically formatted on save using Prettier
- ESLint problems are highlighted as you type
- Common coding errors are caught early
- All developers use consistent editor settings
- Spell checking helps catch typos in comments and strings
- Markdown files are properly formatted and follow best practices

NOTE: If the automatic formatting or linting isn't working:

1. Make sure you've installed the recommended extensions
2. Try reloading VS Code
3. Verify that the file you're editing is included in the paths specified in your npm scripts

### Improving The Documentation

Documentation is crucial for our project's success. Consider updating:

1. The [_main_ README.md](./README.md)
2. The [\_examples folder's README.md](./_examples/README.md)

The following types of changes are welcome:

- adding missing documentation
- clarifying existing documentation
- fixing grammatical and/or spelling mistakes
